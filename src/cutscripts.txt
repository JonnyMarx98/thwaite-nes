<Z> OK, last night, what happen?
<X> Somebody set up us the bomb.
<Y> I only wish we get signal.
<X> I'm just glad none of those
missiles hit.

== perfect_mon_script ==
<Y> $C and $J are doing
a great job.
<X> They'd better.
Because if one of those
lands on my house...
<Z> Then you can come live
with me!

== perfect_tue_script ==
<Z> It's like we get a fireworks
show every night!  We don't
even have to wait for July.
<X> Cool it, $Z.
It's not fun and games.

== perfect_wed_script ==
<Z> Last night's show was even
more impressive!
<Y> You know what, $Z?
I'm starting to think
you're right.
<Y> Because if it weren't just
a show, something would
have been blown up by now.
<X> I don't know, but it makes
me so nervous I can't sleep.

== perfect_thu_script ==
<Z> I think I'll go in and tell
them what a great show!
<Y> Don't bother; it's probably
scripted.  A machine aims
the shells on set paths.
<Y> And even if they did hit the
ground, which won't happen,
<Y> I bet they wouldn't
actually do anything.
<X> Keep saying that and
there'll certainly
be a caTAStrophe.

== perfect_fri_script ==
<X> I still think the threat is
real, but no one believes me.
<X> Everyone else in town has
bought into $Y's theory
<X> that it's all a show and
no one is in any danger.
<Z> They're fan-TAS-tic!

== perfect_sat_script ==
<Z> Aww man, no more fireworks!
<X> My life is a steaming pile
of tech demo.
<N> It's a secret to everybody.
<N> Thank you for TASing Thwaite.
Feel free to play again
at full speed :P

<X> Our houses! Ruined!
<Z> If we can just hold
together, I know we can
get through this.

== discover_clue_1 ==
<Y> I was looking in the
wreckage of $X's house
when I noticed something.
<Y> Look at this.
<Z> It's half melted.
What's that supposed to be?
<Y> I'm not sure.
There's some writing on it,
but I can't make it out.
<X> Could be a guitar pick.
Someone has a strange taste
in shrapnel.

== discover_clue_2 ==
<Y> I found some wire in the
ruins of your house, $X.
<Y> It looks sort of like
piano wire. Do you play
an instrument?
<X> No. Why do you ask?
<Y> It might be from the missile
that hit your house.
<Z> I'd go look myself, but
I keep thinking about my
tummy.

== discover_clue_3 ==
<Y> I got back from the police
station. I was looking at
the evidence,
<Y> and I'm not positive it's
piano wire. It might be a
guitar string.
<X> Guitar pick? Guitar string?
I bet $M is behind this!
<X> I *knew* something was up
with him last Saturday night.

== end_script ==
<X> $M! My house! You...
<M> OK, man, I confess.
I did it.
<X> Shame on you!
You better never show your
face in this town again.
<Z> Chill, $X. Hear him out.
<M> I don't know what came
over me.
<M> It all started after
Videomation.
<M> People drew things, but
they couldn't save them.
<M> Once Mario Paint came out,
people could make drawings
and music to last.
<M> After that, creativity
exploded.
<Z> Exploded, yeah, like
the O in the title.
<M> There are things you don't
know about me.
<M> I've been playing with
explosives for a long time.
<M> They're like music: they can
be used for good or bad.
<Y> As Alfred Nobel found out
soon after he invented
dynamite.
<M> Good things like blowing up
the west and east cliffs
for more living space.
<M> And bad things like
what I ended up doing.
<M> I'm sorry, man.
Let me make it up to you.
<M> First I'll give the museum
a full set of my bootlegs.
<M> Then I'll help fix all
your houses.
<M> And about your wasted
fireworks:
I've got better ones.
<X> I don't know...
<Z> Come on, $X.
